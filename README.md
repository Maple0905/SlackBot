# SlackSharedChannelFirewall
This project will allow a workspace owner in slack to share a channel with another slack workspace, but will not allow any DMs to process. This works with message threading. This is a a solution, to separate minors/cleared adults and their parents/guardians while still having them chime in on specific channels.
